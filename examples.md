### 🦉 [For Young Minds: Hello Infinity](hello_infinity.md)
**The Ant vs. The Owl.**
Infinity is too big to walk, but it fits inside a camera lens. A simple explanation of how geometry tames the "never-ending" line.

### 💻 [For Developers: Hello Universe](hello_universe.md)
**Iteration vs. Projection.**
The fundamental flaw of the `for` loop. Why searching an array is an admission of ignorance, and how Projection fixes it.

### 🧠 [For AI Engineers: Hello Multiverse](hello_multiverse.md)
**The Curse of Dimensionality.**
How to find intersections in Hyperspace without searching billions of vectors. Tensor Projection scales linearly ($O(D)$), not exponentially ($O(N^D)$).

### ⚛️ [For Physicists: Hello Vacuum](hello_vacuum.md)
**The Vacuum Catastrophe.**
Why Quantum Field Theory fails by summing modes (Iteration), and how BOA succeeds by measuring the horizon (Projection).

### 📐 [For Mathematicians: Hello Topology](hello_topology.md)
**Exact Closure.**
The failure of Riemann Sums. How to achieve perfect topological closure on a discrete manifold without infinite limits.

### 📐 [The Infinite Viewport](hello_viewport.md)
Stop indexing. Start projecting.
A navigation component that renders a dataset of 1 Quadrillion items with the same performance cost as a list of 10 items. No buffering. No loading states. Just math.
