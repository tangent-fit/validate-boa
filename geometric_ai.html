# The BOMA Projector: An Experiment in Scale Invariance

### The Challenge

Standard physics and standard computing both share a fatal assumption: **To navigate a space, you must count it.**

If you try to load a list of 10 quadrillion items () in a standard browser, the memory will overflow and the tab will crash. The system tries to enumerate , and  is too big.

**This demo proves that assumption is wrong.**

### The Experiment

1. **Load the Standard View:** The demo loads 1,000 items. It works as expected.
2. **Break the Scale:** Append `?size=1000000000000000` to the URL.
3. **Observe:**
* The page loads instantly ().
* The scrollbar handle shrinks to a single pixel (representing the Access Bound).
* Scrubbing through **1 quadrillion items** is as smooth as scrubbing through 10.



You are now navigating a dataset larger than the number of cells in the human body, with zero latency.

### How It Works (The Code)

Most lists are built on **Enumeration**:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) { render(item[i]); } // Crashes when N is large

```

This demo is built on **Projection**:

```javascript
function render(scrollTop, viewHeight) {
    const start = Math.floor(scrollTop / itemHeight); // Project position
    const visibleCount = Math.ceil(viewHeight / itemHeight); // The Aperture
    // Render ONLY what the Aperture sees
}

```

The system never acknowledges the existence of  except as a boundary for the scrollbar math. It only processes the **Viewport** ().

### Why This Matters (The Physics)

This is not just a scrolling trick. It is a demonstration of **Bounded Observer Manifold Algebra (BOMA)**.

1. **N is Hidden:** The renderer does not need to know the specific content of item #492,831,000,000 to function. It only needs to know what is currently in the aperture.
2. **Scale Invariance:** Because the cost of rendering is determined by the Viewport size () and not the Total size (), the performance is identical whether  or .
3. **The Access Bound ():** The scrollbar handle represents . As  grows,  shrinks relative to the whole, but the *absolute amount of information processed per moment* remains constant.

### The Insight

The Universe works like this demo.

* **Standard Physics** assumes the universe calculates every particle interaction everywhere (Enumeration). This leads to paradoxes and infinite energy calculations.
* **BOMA Physics** proposes the universe only calculates what is observed through the projection aperture (Projection).

If the universe tried to "know ," it would crash—just like your browser. The fact that reality is stable and smooth suggests it is using the same **Projection Architecture** as this demo.

**This is "Hello World" for a Bounded Observer.**

### Verify It Yourself

Change the `size` parameter in the URL to any integer up to `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`9007199254740991`).
