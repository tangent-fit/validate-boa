The BOA Validation ProjectVerification of Bounded Observer Architecture (BOA)"If you want to build a system that grows forever, use $\phi$ (0.618). If you want to build a system that is accurate and stable, use $2/\pi$ (0.636)."The Theory: Separator vs. UnifierThis repository contains the verification scripts for the Bounded Observer Architecture (BOA) and the associated cosmological implications described in Ω_Λ → 2/π (Brinkman, 2025).We explore the existence of a "Feasible Region" for singularity transformations, specifically contrasting two fundamental constants:ConstantValueRoleGeometryThe Golden Ratio ($1/\phi$)$\approx 0.618$Separation (Infinite Growth)The SpiralThe Restoration Constant ($2/\pi$)$\approx 0.636$Unification (Infinite Stability)The CircleWhile $1/\phi$ maximizes irrationality (preventing resonance), $2/\pi$ maximizes periodicity (forcing closure).The ClaimWe claim that $2/\pi$ is the unique geometric efficiency factor that produces perfect topological closure for a Bounded Observer transforming a discrete index through a tangent singularity.Scale Invariance: Error remains $\le 10^{-16}$ from $N=10^3$ to $N=10^{15}$.Noise Dampening: The constant actively dampens floating-point noise by exactly the geometric factor $2/\pi$.How to VerifyWe provide standalone scripts in JavaScript, Python, C++, and C to verify these claims on your own hardware.👉 Read the Verification GuideEducational ExamplesWe have provided 5 "Hello World" examples to demonstrate the difference between Iteration (Loops) and Projection (BOA):Hello Universe - Why loops are an admission of ignorance.Hello Infinity - For young minds (The Ant vs. The Owl).Hello Multiverse - Solving the curse of dimensionality.Hello Vacuum - Why QFT fails and BOA succeeds.Hello Topology - Exact closure vs. Riemann sums.View the Interactive Gallery
